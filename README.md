# Godot Discord Server Bot

A small discord bot written in JavaScript. It provides informational commands related
to the Godot server. It is primarly developed for the official godot discord server,
but can be used for other servers too.

## Setup

### Obtaining a Token

Please follow the [discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
for creating an application and getting a token.

### Configuring the Bot

Create a JavaScript file at `./instance/config.js` with the following content, or use the included exampleConfig.js:

```js
/** @type {import('../src/lib/client').ModularClientConfig} */
const config = {
  clientId: "CLIENT_ID",
  token: "TOKEN",
  admins: [],
  docVersions: {
    3: { displayName: "Godot 3 (LTS)", urlFragment: "3.6" },
    4: { displayName: "Godot 4 (stable)", urlFragment: "stable" },
  },
  guildConfigs: {
    "GUILD_ID": { modChannel: "CHANNEL_ID", modRole: "ROLE_ID" },
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `TOKEN`, `CHANNEL_ID`, `ROLE_ID`, `GUILD_ID` with the correct values. The `"admins"` field is
a list of user IDs as strings. These users will have permission to refresh the slash
commands registered for the discord application. At the very least this list should
contain your own user ID.
The `"guildConfigs"` field should list all guild IDs that the commands should be registered
in, followed with the channel used for moderation alerts, and moderator role that should be pinged in that server.

## Running the Bot

### Node

If you have node and npm already on your system, you can install the needed packages
using `npm install`. After that you can run `node .` to start the bot.

You can also use nodemon to automatically restart the bot when you change the source
files. You don't need to install nodemon globally, instead just run the "dev" lifecycle
script: `npm run dev`

### Docker/Podman

The Containerfile uses multiple stages. By default a production build is generated.

You can instead build with `--target bot-dev` to get a container with nodemon to
automatically restart the bot when the source files change.

The development container expects you to mount the host `./src` directory into the
container at `/home/bot/src` so that nodemon can monitor changes.

Example for building and running the dev container:

```bash
podman build --target bot-dev --tag godot-discord-bot .
podman run -v ./src:/home/bot/src -it godot-discord-bot
```

Since the source files are mounted into the container, you don't need to rebuild the
container image often. An explicit rebuild is only needed when the dependencies are
updated.

## Usage

### Registering Commands

On the first run and whenever you add or remove commands (or their arguments), you need to tell discord about these changes. To do so, send a private message "refresh commands" to the bot. It will then run the update procedure.

### Using Commands

#### Slash Commands

Type `/` into a message prompt on a server with the bot. It will show you a list of
all available slash commands with a small description each.

#### Context Menu Commands

Right click on either a user name or message to view a list of available actions and
commands available for each.

## Contributing

### Code Structure

The code is organized into "Units". A unit is basically a collection of commands that
belong together. Have a look at the files in `./src/units` to get an overview.

These unit files get dynamically loaded by the modular client class. Basically
everything in `.src/lib` is the backbone used for loading and running the unit
files.
